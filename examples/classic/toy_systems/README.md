This folder contains a number of notebooks using aimmd to learn the committor of 2D toy potentials (with added orthogonal and irrelevant dimensions to make the learning task more challenging and realistic).
There are various variants of these notebooks using different neural network architectures and machine learning backends, they do not differ in any other regard, so it is probably enough to do one "sequence" of notebooks.
