## Example notebooks for ``aimmd.distributed``

The example notebooks found in the ``distributed`` folder (and its subfolders) are all concerned with how to setup, run, and analyze a (large) number of TPS simulations simultaneously, all steered by one common committor model.

## TODO: Example notebooks using openpathsampling for sequential TPS

Here should be a list (and short description) of the various example notebooks. This list will be done when the notebooks are reorganized. It would be good to have/move them all in one subfolder (like for aimmd.distributed). When this list and short description is done the notebooks (or the readme of the folder as for distributed) should also be added to the toctree above!
