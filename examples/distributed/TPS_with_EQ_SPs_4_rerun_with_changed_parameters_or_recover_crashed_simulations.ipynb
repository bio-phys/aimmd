    "## Notebook 4: Rerun TPS simulation with changed parameters/Recover crashed simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fourth of a series of example notebooks on massively parallel transition path sampling. Here you will learn how you can rerun a TPS simulation from the folder structure and files on disk (possibly changing the reaction coordinate model architecture and/or `descriptor_transform`). Note, that the same setup/logic can also be used to recover and continue a simulation that has incomplete Monte Carlo steps, either due to the machine it has been running on crashing or you terminating the simulation during runtime. In both cases we will use the `reinitialize_from_workdir` method, which will take care of adding all exisiting Monte Carlo steps to the new storage and then finish all partially finished trials. This will result in a brain object that has the same internal state as if it would have ran the simulation up to the current step and that can be used to continue the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook should be run on a multi-core workstation preferably with a GPU**, otherwise you will have a very long coffee break and a very hot laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required knowledge/recommended reading:** This notebooks assumes some familarity with the `asyncmd` (namely the [gromacs] engine and TrajectoryFunctionWrapper classes). Please see the example notebooks in `asyncmd` for an introduction."

    "To reinitialize the TPS we need to create a fresh brain object using the usual ingridients, just that this time we must take care for many things to set them to the same values as in the initial simulation we are reinitializing:\n",
    " - We must set the number of markov chain Markov chain samplers to the number we used previously\n",
    " - We must create a new storage file to save our models, trainset and other simulation results\n",
    " - We must use the same metastable state definition as previously (otherwise we will break the Markov chain by changing the length of the transitions and potentially changing the state assignment of endstates)\n",
    " - We must define the underlying dynamics the be the same as in the previous simulation, i.e. we can only change engine options that do not change the propagator $p(x_{t + \\Delta t} | x_{t}, \\Delta t)$ (where $x_{t}$ is a phase space point on a trajectory at time $t$). That means we can not change the forcefield, temperature and pressure coupling, and many more, but we should be able to change engine options like the number of threads and many more to e.g. optimize efficiency on changed hardware.\n",
    " - There is no need to load the old initial transitions, except if you (like we do here) want to get the dimensionality of your `descriptor_transform` by applying it to them.\n",
    " - You can change both the `descriptor_transform` and the reaction coordinate model architecture. Note however, that the Markov chain acceptances in the chain will be unchanged (i.e. calculated by the old model) up to the last previously finished step.\n",
    " - You must define the same sampling scheme, i.e. use the same number of movers and corresponding probabilities.\n",
    " - You should create a new trainset into which we will add the simulation results (shooting outcomes) including the ones found on disk.\n",
    " - You can define different `Task`s to run after specified number of trials."

If we call it with `run_tasks=True` (the default) it will also run all of its attached tasks for those trials in the order they finished. This will add the trials to the trainingset and train the model as if it would have steered this simulation itself (except that it did not select the SPs, but it will still predict for them before observing the result and be trained according to its prediction quality). After adding all finished trials the coroutine will check for any unfinished trials and finish them. After that you can continue the simulation with the brain object and potentialy a new reaction coordinate model."
