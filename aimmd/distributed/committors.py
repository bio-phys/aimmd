# TODO: DOCUMENT! (and clean up)
class CommittorSimulation:
    """
    Run committor simulation for multiple starting configurations in parallel.

    Given a list of starting configurations and a list of states propagate
    trajectories until any of the states is reached. Write out the concatenated
    trajectory from the starting configuration to the first state.
    When twoway shooting is performed additionally write out any potential
    transitions (going from the lower index state to the higher index state).
    Note that the `CommittorSimulation` allows for the simulation of different
    ensembles per starting configuration (see the `__init__` docstring).

    Attributes
    ----------
    states_reached : np.ndarray(shape=(n_conf, n_states))
        Return states_reached as a np.array with shape (n_conf, n_states),
        where the entries give the counts of states reached, i.e. the format is
        as in an `aimmd.TrainSet`.
    states_reached_per_shot : np.ndarray(shape=(n_conf, n_shots, n_states))
        A np.array shape (n_conf, n_shots, n_states), where the entries
        give the counts of states reached for every single shot, i.e. summing
        over the states axis will always give 1 (or 2 if twoway=True).
    shot_counter : int
        Number of trial shots done per configuration so far.
    trajs_to_state : list[list[asyncmd.Trajectory]]
        All produced trajectories until the first state is reached, for each
        configuration seperately.
    trajs_to_state_bw : list[list[asyncmd.Trajectory]]
        All produced trajectories until the first state is reached for the
        backwards (inverted velocity) shot if `two_way=True`, also for each
        configuration seperately.
    transitions : list[list[asyncmd.Trajectory]]
        If `two_way=True` and the forward and backward trial end in different
        states a transition was produced. Also sorted by configuration,
        transitions go from the lower index state to the higher index state.
    fname_traj_to_state : str
        The name to use for the concatenated trajectory until the first state
        is reached.
    fname_traj_to_state_bw : str
        The name to use for the concatenated trajectory until the first state
        is reached in the backwards trial (if `two_way=True`).
    fname_transition_traj : str
        The filename to use for the potentially produced transitions (if
        `two_way=True`).
    deffnm_engine_out : str
        The deffnm to use for the molecular dynamics engine.
    deffnm_engine_out_bw : str
        The deffnm to use for the molecular dynamics engine in the backwards
        trial (if `two_way=True`).
    max_retries_on_crash : int
        How many times we should retry a trial if the molecular dynamics engine
        crashed.

    Methods
    -------
    run(n_per_struct)
        Performs `n_per_struct` (additional) committor trials for every
        starting configuration.
    reinitialize_from_workdir(overwrite=False)
        Restore self into the state as if we would have ran all exisiting
        committor trials found in workdir (potentially finishing unfinished
        ones and adding missing ones) but honoring a potentially changed state
        definition, i.e. extending trials and returning shorter trajectories to
        the states where needed. Additional (missing) twoway shoots are also
        performed if `self.two_way == True`.

        """
        Initialize a `CommittorSimulation`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        workdir : str
            Absolute or relative path to an existing working directory.
        starting_configurations : list of iterables
            Each entry in the list is describing a starting configuration and
            must have at least the two entries:
                (`asyncmd.Trajectory`, `index_of_conf_in_traj`)
            It can optionally have the form:
                (`asyncmd.Trajectory`, `index_of_conf_in_traj`,
                 `name_for_configuration`)
        states : list[asyncmd.trajectory.TrajectoryFunctionWrapper]
            A list of state functions, preferably wrapped using any
            `asyncmd.trajectory.TrajectoryFunctionWrapper`.
        engine_cls : A subclass of `aimmd.distributed.MDEngine` or list therof
            The molecular dynamics engine to use.
        engine_kwargs : dict or list[dict]
            A dictionary with keyword arguments that can be used to instantiate
            the engine given as `engine_cls`.
        T : float or list[float]
            The temperature to use when generating Maxwell-Boltzmann velocities
        walltime_per_part : float
            Walltime per trajectory segment in hours, note that this does not
            limit the maximum length of the combined trajectory but only the
            size/time per single trajectory segment.
        n_max_concurrent : int
            The maximum number of trials to propagate concurrently, note that
            for two way simulations you will run 2*`n_max_concurrent` molecular
            dynamics simulations in parallel.
        two_way : bool or list[bool]
            Wheter to run molecular dynamcis forwards and backwards in time.
        max_steps : int or None
            The maximum number of integration steps to perform in total per
            trajectory, note that for two way simulations the combined maximum
            length of the resulting trajectory will be 2*`max_steps`.

        Note that all attributes can be set at intialization by passing keyword
        arguments with their name.

        Note, that the `CommittorSimulation` allows the simulation of different
        physical ensembles for every starting configuration. This is achieved
        by allowing the parameters `engine_cls`, `engine_kwargs`, `T` and
        `twoway` to be either singletons (then they are the same for the whole
        committor simulation) or a list with of same length as
        `starting_configurations`, i.e. one value per starting configuration.
        This means you can simulate systems differing in the number of
        molecules (by changing the topology used in the engine), at different
        pressures (by changing the molecular dynamics parameters passed with
        `engine_kwargs`), at different temperatures (by changing `T` and
        the parameters in the `engine_kwargs`) and even perform two way
        shots only for a selected subset of starting configurations (e.g. the
        ones you expect to be a transition state).
